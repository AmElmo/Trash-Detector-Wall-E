# ðŸ’¡ Description

Wall-E detects trash on a live video feed and automatically classifies it among
7 main categories (paper, plastic, metal, glass, organic, e-waste and non-recyclable),

# ðŸ¤– Stack overview

Languages: Python & JavaScript
Roboflow for image annotations
Tensorflow API for modeling
Tensorflow JS for deployment to production

# ðŸªœ Project steps

## 1. ðŸ’½ Data collection

Datasets used :
- TACO: https://github.com/pedropro/TACO
- Drinking Waste Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arkadiyhacks/drinking-waste-classification
- Fruit Detection: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fruit-detection
- Fruit Images for Object Detection: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbkinaci/fruit-images-for-object-detection
- Mobile Images Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirhamzahaq/mobile-images-dataset
- Garbage Classification: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification (added custom annotations for cardboard & paper categories)

## 2. ðŸ§¹ Data cleaning & preprocessing

The 2 datasets used did not have the same split of categories. We combined them to form 7 unique categories commonly used for recycling purposes:
1. Paper
2. Plastic
3. Glass
4. Metal
5. Organic
6. E-Waste
7. Non-recyclable

Step 1: change annotations of TACO dataset to reduce from 60 categories to 7 categories

Step 2: match the 4 categories of the Drinking_Waste_Classification dataset to match our 7 categories

Step 3: combine all annotations into one file (PASCAL, JSON, ???)

## 3. âœ¨ Model selection & training

## 4. ðŸ“¸ Test predictions on photos

## 5. ðŸš² Lifecycle setup of model

## 6. ðŸŒŸ Deployment to JavaScript app
